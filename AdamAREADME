# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.
When I hit https://www.techtonic.com/ my computer/ web browser (the client) is requesting information from a server to deliver the website content to my screen.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?
First I type in the URL containing the domain name which is the written form of the IP address. My web browser then loads files from a remote server containing the websites data, which my web browser's browser engine sifts through to figure out what to display to me by converting bytes of HTML data the browser can understand (a DOM object). This is done by having the bytes convert into characters, convert into tokens into node into DOM or CSSOM to the render tree to lay out.

## What code is rendered in the browser?
HTML.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?
To deliver information and interact with files and databases.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?
To request information and user interface.



## What is runtime?
This is a technical term for the amount of time a program is running.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?
Once, from the time it is requested.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?
Once, from the time it is delivered.
## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?
One per connection is typical.

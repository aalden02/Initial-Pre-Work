// After a variable is declared, if they remain uninitialized, they are by default, undefined and therefore can not be manipulate to complete mathematical expressions, and will ultimately result in a NaN  (Not a number) or literally a string that says "undefined".
// Initialize these three variables
var a=5;
var b=10;
var c= "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

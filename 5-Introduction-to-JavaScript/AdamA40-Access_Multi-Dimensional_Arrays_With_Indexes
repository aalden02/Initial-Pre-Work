//I learned how indexing works for multidimensional arrays, from the outer most arrays in the first bracket to inner data points within the arrays in subsequent brackets.
// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];

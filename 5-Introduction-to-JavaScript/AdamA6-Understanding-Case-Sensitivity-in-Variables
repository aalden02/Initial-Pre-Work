// I learned how variable declarations and subsequent assignments are all case sensitive and a best practice solution known as camelCase where variables consist of at least two words, the first word is undercase and all following words start with a capitalized letter.
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

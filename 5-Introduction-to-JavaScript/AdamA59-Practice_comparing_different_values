//This lesson further reinforced the difference between equality and strict equality and also talked about a different operator (typeof) that can ID what type of data a variable contains (number, string etc.)
// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
compareEquality(10, "10");

//I learned how to find a value in a string, using brackets[] at the end of a statement with a number value in between the brackets to ask which value in the string to choose. 0 is the first value in the sequence instead of 1.
// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];

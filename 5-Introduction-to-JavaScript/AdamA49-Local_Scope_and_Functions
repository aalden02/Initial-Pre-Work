//My main takeaway from this lesson is that variables can be declared locally for the sole purpose of being used within a particular function as opposed to globally, throughout the code.
function myLocalScope() {
  'use strict'; // you shouldn't need to edit this line
  var myVar=1;
  console.log(myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope


// Now remove the console log line to pass the test

// One can concantenate strings through the += operator that similarly combines a previously declared string with a new one.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

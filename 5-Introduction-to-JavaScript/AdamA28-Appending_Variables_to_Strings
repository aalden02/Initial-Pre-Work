//I learned I can also append one string to another using a += operator.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective= "super awesome!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;

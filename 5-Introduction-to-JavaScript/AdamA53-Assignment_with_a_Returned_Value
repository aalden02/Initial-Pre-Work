//This assignment through me through a loop, it was like doing extradimensional algebra, I had to first understand the logic of the previous code, and fit the proper algebraic expression within the framework of that logic to get the final result to agree with the predetermined variable.
// Example
var changed = 0;

function change(num) {
  return (num + 5) / 3;
}

changed = change(10);

// Setup
var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code( below this line
var processed= 2;
function processArg(num){
return (num-5);
}
processed= processArg(7);

//I learned how to assign values to different variable and get them to = each other. An important note is, much like CSS/HTML logic, commands/inputs/declarations at the bottom of the code override similar pieces of code that come before.
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var b = 7;
var a = 7;
 b=a;
